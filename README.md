# MiniMed-370-g-data-analyzer
Code Louisville C# Project

I use the MiniMed 370 g insulin pump. One of the abilities of this pump is to wirelessly upload data to a website which will generate a csv file with data from the pump. This data includes Blood Glucose (BG) readings from a meter as well as Interstitial SIGnal (ISIG) readings from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) worn in conjunction with the pump. ISIG levels are used to calculate a calibration factor which will predict BG readings from the CGM readings. My intention is to analyze BG and ISIG readings from my pump and identify that correlation. This project is the first step in that process. This project will read in the CSV file and allow me to read, modify and persist the data. In this project I did not use the raw data from the pump. I used a sanitized version of the CSV file so that I could learn to work with the data. Future versions of this analyzer will be able to parse the raw data from the website and will be able to do some meaningfull analysis of that data.

To use this analyzer, you will need the cs files and the csv file. When you run the program you will be presented with fairly self explanatory options. BG and ISIG are glucose readings that roughly run from 40 to 600. 120 is normal. There are five data fields that you will work with. Index, Date, Time, BG and ISIG. The data is persisted into a file that will be found in the bin debug directory.
